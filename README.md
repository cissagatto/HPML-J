# HPML-J

This code is a part of my doctoral research at PPG-CC/DC/UFSCar. HPML-J is the name of the first experiment carried out: Hybrid Partitions for Multi-Label Classification with index Jaccard. Other two versions will be available soon: HPML-KN and HPML-KT (K = kohonen, N = normal, T = transpose).


## Multi-Label Datasets
You can download the multi-label datasets in this link: https://cometa.ujaen.es/datasets/

## Scripts
This source code consists of a R project for R Studio and the following R scripts, folders and files:

01. libraries
02. utils
03. preprocessing
04. miscellaneous
05. correlations
06. partitions
07. clusValidation
08. clusHybrid
09. clusGlobal
10. clusLocal
12. Run
13. executeForOneDataset

Please, after your download, confirms if the folder UTILS contains the following files: Clus.jar, R_csv_2_arff. jar and weka.jar. Without this libraries the code not runs.

## Requirements
This code was develop in R Studio Version 1.3.959 Â© 2009-2020, PBC, "Middlemist Red" (3a09be39, 2020-05-18) for Windows. The R language version is 4.0.1 (2020-06-06) with x86_64-w64-mingw32 plataform.

This code may or may not be executed in parallel, however, it is highly recommended that you run it in parallel. The number of cores can be configured via the command line. In our experiments we used ten cores. For reproducibility we recommend that you also use ten cores.
